Many men, many minds. Some rules can be work differently for different people. We select new best practices directly of after discussion.

## Discussions

If you want to discuss some practice, please check existing issues with tag `#discussion` or create a new issue when nothing found. Changes in practices without discussion will not be accepted (except of typos).

## Adding new best practice

To add a new best practice you have to:

1. create an issue with a new best practice name and tag `#discussion`;
1. fork the repository; 
1. change `README.md`;
1. create a pull request assigned to the issue.

If there is a well-known or obvious rule, it will be merged soon. Otherwise, the decision will be made after discussion.

Provide a link to a public proof page (Documentation, SAP help or SAP blogs) when possible.

## Changing the best practice

If you want to apply a meaningful change to a best practice create an issue with tag `#discussion` (or find existing one) and assign your pull request to it.
